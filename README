This is my port of the LitePost project using the CFWheels framework.  LitePost is a lightweight ColdFusion-based blogging
application.

Unzip to webroot.  Then execute the litepost.sql script in the db/ folder.  The script works in MySQL 5.  It will likely need tweaking for
MS SQL Server.  Set up a dsn in CF Administrator.  CFWheels by convention will expect the dsn to be the same as your
application folder.  If you use anything else, you'll need to modify the settings.cfm in the config/ folder.  Add a record to the
users table so that you can log in and begin making blog entries.
